  Good, but not great pencils. Included lead is a little weak. Would recommend for use less than one year.

Your 7 most negative review wassomething i've noticed about these pencils is that there may be one or two in the pack that are a little faulty. when you erase something, no matter how little pressure you use, the led gets pushed out of the pencil. it can be annoying to put back in, but you'll have some decent ones that don't do this so it's okay.
Your 8 most negative review wasLeaves little mess behind and lead is strong!
